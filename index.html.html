    <p style ="color: black;">
        College life is a new and exciting phase in my life.
		At the beginning of the semester, college life felt calm and manageable. 
		As the semester progressed and external examinations approached, academic pressure increased. 
		During this phase, I questioned the relevance of studying subjects like Chemistry and Physics 
		I realized that completing academic requirements is essential for earning a degree as my ambition is to become a civil servant.
		 This understanding helped me accept the process and grow mentally during my first year of B.Tech.

    <b style="color: maroon;">Friends in my college life</b>
    <p style ="color: black;">
        After joining graduation, many students miss their Intermediate friends and the closeness they shared.
		 However, I did not feel that sense of loss even a little, as I am grateful to have such wonderful friends in my life.
		  We share fun moments, tease each other, and enjoy being playful together. 
		  Along with this, we participated in NSS programs and shared our good and bad experiences. 
		  Even though we belong to different branches, we remain affectionate, supportive, and strongly connected.

    <b style="color: maroon;">Coming to Studies in Btech</b>
    <p style = "color:black;">
        B.Tech academics require self-discipline, consistency, and independent learning. 
		Preparing for exams and interviews made me realize the importance of confidence and self-reliance, 
		as each individual must face academic challenges on their own. 
		This understanding helped me grow academically and mentally during my first year.

    <b style="color: maroon;">Lesson I Learned</b>
    <p style = "color: black;">
        My first year of B.Tech taught me several important life lessons.
		 I learned the value of patience, self-discipline, and adaptability while facing academic pressure. 
		 I understood that interest alone is not enough; consistency and responsibility are essential for growth. 
		 This year also helped me become more independent, confident, and mentally stronger.
